Litte number guess game

First project in HTML/CSS/JS, this project is from a JS course on Udemy, even though i had the HTML/CSS provided by the course, i decided to do it from scratch using those files as references (only how it should look overall). This is not a so serious project (that's why variable and function names aren't "good"). A lot to improve on but had fun doing it.

If ur reading this, have a great rest of your day :D
